Loki's CSS Zen Garden

My overall concept is to style this page in a sort of Old Norse/Viking theme, but the real theme is that it's a CSS Zen Garden design as conceived by Loki, the Norse trickster god. Loki revels in chaos, change, and duplicity, and I'd like to have the site reflect that. So while the site itself looks fairly standard--there's nothing really out of the ordinary with my design--I plan on using CSS effects like transition, animation, and transform to alter the user's experience so they aren't quite sure what they're getting. I suppose from a usability standpoint this is a terrible idea, but I just think it's cool and want to take the next step into some of the more advanced CSS attributes. I'd also like to use Google Fonts. 

I hope to confuse and baffle the user, but in an entertaining way. Like a trickster god. You know.

I could look at the code on this all day. I wish they'd included the images, though. I can see that most of the sites I really admire were made with the help of or by a graphic designer, and I just don't have those skills. 

I'm really looking forward to this assignment, but I'm pretty sure it's something I'll have to return to.
